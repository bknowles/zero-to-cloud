# Know Yourself

* What is it that allows you to stay at a suboptimal job?
    + The People?
    + The Work?
    + The Money?
* For Me
    + People >> Work >> Money

.notes 30 seconds -- talk about what kept you working at the library for
4.5 years

# Tools First

Quote:

    "If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend
    six hours sharpening my axe.  Give me six hours to
    chop down a tree and I will spend the first four
    sharpening the axe." -- Abraham Lincoln

.notes 30 seconds -- talk about building the tools for building a
Statistical Quality Control DBMS for Imprimis

# Value of Education, Dogfood, & #1 Revisited

* Humans tend to not value something until it is gone or they are no longer there 
* Eating your own dogfood is a sign that you are committed to succeed and you will bet your own business on your product
    + __However__ -- Don't lose sight of who the real customer(s) is (are)

.notes 15 seconds -- talk about sorting algorithms and how that made you
appreciate your education.  30 seconds -- talk about DCA being responsible
for the DNS for all of Arpanet but not using DNS internally.  30 seconds --
talk about the plan to create SIPRNET using hosts.txt tables and random
invalid IP address ranges

# DevOps vs. Politics

* For DevOps to be successful, you __MUST__ have complete buy-in from stem-to-stern
* As soon as a single person isn't 100% committed to the teamwork required, the whole corporate train starts going off the rails

.notes 30 seconds -- talk about what it was like to work side-by-side with (and
for) the developers at AOL, versus what happened when all the Ops personnel
got ripped out and put into a separate organization

# Family vs. Job, Value of Networking, & Rule of Three

* Not Company vs. Home Life, but Company __AS__ Family, vs. Company __AS__ Job
    + If the company pitches itself as a family, but treats everyone as employees, you are on a path for disaster
* The Collective is Much More Resourceful and Much Smarter than the Individual
* However Long You Honestly Think it will Take, Multiply by Three

.notes 30 seconds -- talk about what it
was like to be able to call on many experts in many fields, up to and
including Stephen Potter (Camel Book) and Curtis Preston (Backups and
Storage).  30 seconds -- talk about estimating how long it's going to take
to get work done, and then tripling the estimate because of too many
unknown and unknowable factors.

# More Value of Communities & Preparing to Speak/Teach

* Experienced Smart People doing Intelligent Design with Open Source can lead to Novel Work
    + Which can lead to invitations to speak at conferences
	- Which can lead to meeting lots of other very experienced and smart people
* Preparing to speak at a conference or teach a tutorial tends to force me to really dig deep to completely and totally understand the material

.notes 30 seconds -- talk about doing work at Skynet that was actually
kind of ground-breaking and how that led to meeting people at many
different places, the "Hallway Track", the virtual hallway track online,
and how preparing to speak or teach makes you really dig down deep to
learn the material backwards and forwards.

# Location & Localization vs. Culturation & Distance

* Signficant physical distance makes work/life relationships hard
* Significant cultural and/or linguistic distance makes them harder
* Combine with economic downturn, and you may have the Perfect Storm

.notes 30 seconds -- (Snow) talk about your view that if you're in a foreign
place you really need to learn the language and the culture no matter what, 
and even if the physical distance is minimal, if the cultural difference is
too much, then success is unlikely

# If You Don't Have the Proof, "It" Doesn't Exist

* You need to take a baseline when things are working well
    + If/when you need that baseline the time when you could have gotten it will have long since passed.

.notes 30 seconds -- talk about the need to get the documentation in
writing when the times are good, and to get the audio recording of the
one-on-one meeting at the time of the first meeting, otherwise whatever is
said verbally won't hold any weight in the future.

# Choose Your Employers and Co-Workers Wisely

* Hiring = Talent Acquisition
    + Work for the kind of people you would want as friends regardless
    + Same for your co-workers
* If You Are Hiring
    + What kind of people you would want with you
	- If you were stuck in an elevator with them
	- ... for 24 hours
* Acquire the Right Talent
    + With the right personalities
    + With the right approaches to problem solving
